# Caffeine Intranet

It's a multi project Angular repository: UI library and its showcase app. In the future there will be 
- a todo app that uses said library
- a login and registration app 

They will be orchestrated in a micro-frontend architecture.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.3.

## How to run it?

Use Angular's dev server.

Install Node v18, run `npm install` in project directory, build the UI library with `ng build caffeine-ui`, launch the dev server with `ng serve caffeine-todo` or `ng serve caffeine-ui-showcase`.
CLI will show you URL that you want to navigate in order to see the application. Default one is `http://localhost:4200/`.
